This Project is about creating a smart vehicle 3D perception demo and proposing a security problem.

We created and simulated this demo using Autoware system that was provided by our instructor. Once we became familiar with the "environment" and understood the details and intricacies on how does this system work, how many sensors it has, what do they do and how do they work together we "played around" with different attacks to the perception stack.

I contributed to this project by completing task 1.2 of the project. This involved trying different defence mechanisms and writing a proposal for a defence technique and trying to implement it to test its' effectivness.
