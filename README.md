# Final-Group-Project-for-CYSE-465

This Project is about creating a smart vehicle 3D perception demo and proposing a security problem.
We created and simulated this demo using the Autoware system that was provided by our instructor. Once we became familiar with the "environment" and understood the details and intricacies on how this system works, how many sensors it has, what they do and how they work together we "played around" with different attacks to the perception stack.
